# Football Goalscorer Prediction

## Description

This project predicts football goalscorers for a given match using player performance data. It combines several independent datasets, such as shooting, passing, and overall player statistics, to assess which players are most likely to score in a match. The model processes historical match results and player stats, applies feature engineering, and ranks players based on computed features, such as goal probability, scoring impact, and passing impact. The aim is to provide accurate predictions of who might score in upcoming matches for both home and away teams.

## Techniques Used

### Feature Engineering
- **Goal Probability**: Calculated by combining expected goals (xG) and goals per shot to reflect both the quantity and quality of shooting opportunities.
- **Scoring Impact**: Incorporates goals, expected goals (xG), and assists from player statistics, offering a broader measure of offensive contribution.
- **Passing Impact**: Derived from key passes and progressive passes, which are indicators of a player's involvement in creating scoring chances.

These features are chosen to capture various aspects of a player's performance: shooting quality, direct contribution to goals, and playmaking ability.

### Imputation for Missing Data
- **Mean Imputation**: Applied to missing numeric values to ensure the model can handle incomplete datasets without losing valuable player information.

This ensures that predictions remain robust, even when some player stats are missing.

### Data Normalization
- **StandardScaler**: Used to normalize the computed features across players, so different types of contributions (shooting, scoring, passing) can be meaningfully compared.

### Ranking and Aggregation
- **Weighted Scoring**: The final prediction score for each player is derived by averaging their performance across shooting, stats, and passing metrics.

### Model Robustness
- Warnings are triggered when there are missing data points or players for a given team, ensuring transparency in predictions when data might be lacking.

## Datasets Used

- **`2023_matchday_results.csv `**: Contains the home and away teams and the actual goals scored in each match.
- **`player_premier_league_shooting.csv`**: Includes player-level shooting metrics such as total shots, goals, and expected goals (xG).
- **`player_premier_league_stats.csv`**: Provides detailed player statistics, including goals, assists, and expected goals.
- **`player_premier_league_passing.csv`**: Includes passing metrics such as key passes and progressive passes, which contribute to goal creation.

## How the Project Could Be Improved

1. **Incorporating Additional Features**:
   - **Defensive Metrics**: Using a defensive stats (e.g., tackles, interceptions) dataset from the same season would help better assess a player's overall influence, especially for midfielders.
   - **Form and Fitness Data**: Including data on recent form, player fitness, and match minutes could further enhance prediction accuracy.
   - **Match Context**: External factors such as home advantage, and fixture congestion could add valuable context to predictions.

2. **Advanced Machine Learning Models**:
   - Implementing more sophisticated algorithms such as Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, or ensemble methods could improve predictive accuracy by capturing more complex patterns in the data.

3. **Team-Level Data**:
   - Incorporating team-level data (e.g., team possession, pressing intensity) could complement individual player stats and provide a more holistic view of match dynamics.

## Limitations

1. **Limited Feature Set**: The current model only considers shooting, passing, and basic player stats. It does not account for external factors like team strategies, defensive setups, player confidence/morale or match-specific conditions which are difficult to quantify.
   
2. **Static Nature**: The model doesn't incorporate real-time updates or player form, which can significantly influence player performance.

3. **Assumptions in Feature Aggregation**: The method assumes that shooting, scoring, and passing contributions are equally important, which may not hold for all players or matches.

4. **Bias in Data Availability**: Players with limited playtime or involvement may not have sufficient data points, which can lead to under-representation in predictions.

By addressing these limitations, the model could provide even more accurate and insightful predictions for football match outcomes.
